# Nurse-Robot-NerBo-
Building AI_ Beginning to NerBo
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
This project focuses on the development of an Autonomous Nurse Robot designed to support healthcare facilities by easing the workload of nurses. The robot will take body temperature and blood pressure readings, enable video/audio communication with family members, and replace bottle of water/ refreshments. These readings will be updated to the cloud or local database via IoT.
## Background

The healthcare sector often faces challenges like high nurse-to-patient ratios, leading to increased workloads and delayed care. This project addresses several critical issues:

Problem 1: Nurses are often overwhelmed with a large number of patients, reducing the frequency of checks/ attention on individual patients.
Problem 2: Patients in hospitals or elderly care homes can feel isolated, especially when unable to regularly communicate with their families.
Problem 3: Manual data collection is time-consuming and can be prone to human error.
Problem 4: Frequent monitoring of vital signs (body temperature, blood pressure) is essential but often neglected due to time constraints.

Personal Motivation: The motivation stems from a desire to enhance patient care while improving the efficiency of healthcare workers, especially in high-demand environments. The topic is important as it addresses both the growing demand for healthcare and the emotional well-being of patients.

## How is it used?

The Autonomous Nurse Robot will be used in healthcare facilities like hospitals, nursing homes, and elderly care centers. The robot will autonomously visit individual patients at scheduled intervals to:

Measure and record body temperature and blood pressure.
Enable real-time video or audio calls for patient communication with family members.
Replace water bottles and ensure the comfort of patients.

The system will operate in environments where routine checks and communication are needed but are often delayed or skipped due to high nurse workloads. The primary users include nurses, patients, and family members, with each having distinct needs:

Nurses will benefit from automation, freeing time for more critical care tasks.
Patients will feel more connected to their families and enjoy timely health checks.
Family members will appreciate the real-time communication with loved ones.

## Data sources and AI methods
The data used in this project will be primarily collected from IoT-enabled sensors integrated into the robot. These sensors will monitor the patients' body temperature and blood pressure. The data will be transferred to the cloud or a local database for further analysis and record-keeping.

AI methods like machine learning may be used to:
Analyze trends in patient vitals over time.
Predict potential health risks based on historical data.
Enhance the robot's ability to move autonomously and navigate healthcare settings.

## Challenges

The project does not:

Fully replace the need for human nurses and doctors, as the robot cannot perform complex medical tasks
Guarantee complete accuracy in measurements and communication, especially if sensors malfunction or networks experience latency.

Ethical considerations:
Privacy concerns surrounding patient data, especially when using cloud services for storage.
Ensuring security to prevent unauthorized access to patient information.
Ensuring the robot’s autonomy doesn’t interfere with human judgment in critical healthcare decisions.

## What next?

This project can grow by incorporating more complex medical monitoring features, such as:

Real-time heart rate monitoring.
Medication reminders and assistance with drug administration.
Integration with electronic health records (EHR) systems for more personalized care.

Skills and assistance needed to move on:
Knowledge of IoT technology for sensor integration and cloud storage solutions.
AI/ML expertise for predictive health analytics and autonomous navigation.
Collaboration with healthcare professionals to ensure the robot’s functionality and safety in real-world settings.



## Acknowledgments
Inspiration for the robot comes from existing healthcare automation technologies, such as telemedicine and robotic assistance in surgeries.
